                The number of web applications being created and used has grown rapidly since the new millenium. And
                importantly, so has the sheer complexity of them -- specially on the front end. No more static pages, no
                sir!

                You have a ton of sections each interacting with each other and the server and yes, it's as complicated
                as
                it sounds and just as hard to pull off. Today, I'd like to talk about a few choice JavaScript frameworks
                that aim to simplify front-end application development.
